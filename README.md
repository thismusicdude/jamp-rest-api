## .env File
Hereâ€™s the section for your README in English, updated to reflect that the `COMPONENT` can be either "omdb" or "mock":

## Configuring the `.env` File

To configure the environment variables for the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the project directory. This file contains important settings that the application will use during runtime. The `.env` file should contain the following variables:

```env
COMPONENT="<component-name>"
OMDB_KEY="<OMDB key>"
DEBUG="<mode>"
```

### Variable Explanations:

- **`COMPONENT`**: Specifies the name of the API component being used. It can either be `omdb` for using the OMDB API or `mock` for using mock data. 
- **`OMDB_KEY`**: Your personal API key for accessing the OMDB API. Replace `<OMDB key>` with your actual API key.
- **`DEBUG`**: Controls the debug mode. Set the value to `"TEST"` if you are running the application in a test environment. This enables a new endpoint to clear all inner data.
